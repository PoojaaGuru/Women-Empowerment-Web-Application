<h2>About Us</h2><br>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">It is confirming that everyday women are dealing with harassment from mild to extreme forms on our streets. How long will this menace go on for? What are we supposed to do about it?
With limited options in our hands, and with time fast flying us by, the onus is on us to wake up and do whatever it takes. 49% of India’s registered voters are women, and the Power of 49 together needs to demand a tougher India, yet an India that is sensitive to women.  
Women’s issues need to be pushed in every lobby until the leaders have no choice but to yield and take a hold on the crisis that looms across every street and every corner of India today. Push the Pins now on issues that matter to you, we will make sure your voice is heard by those that matter. This is the time we own up to ourselves. We stand by each other. Tall and proud. Brave and unfazed. This is the time we own up to India. No more Harassment. We want what we deserve - for us and for our daughters –
 <strong>A safer India for women.</strong></p>
